Rewind
=======

Rewind - A personal timeline and distributed social network engine built in Javascript.

Usage
-------

Install io.js v.1.6.3 or above (Rewind uses native ES6 features like Promises, so if you want to use it with standard Node, you'll need a shim or transpiler like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)).

1. npm install
2. npm start
3. Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/
